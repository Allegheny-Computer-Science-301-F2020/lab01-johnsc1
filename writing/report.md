### Article 1
 -  Article name
2020 MLB rules changes signal future of baseball

-  Reference or article citation.
https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/29787331/mlb-2020-rules-changes-signal-future-game

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
The overall article has to do with recent changes in how the MLB is
operating, but I am specifically focusing on the issues surrounding tracking
the accuracy of umpires.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
The ethical concern is using technology to complete jobs that have historically
been done by people. Although this leads to more accurate results as it helps
eliminate human error, it's not ethical for this to replace or be
used to evaluate a job that is done by humans without the knowledge of the
employee and without the employee's input.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
Data collected from where the baseball moves on the field during games.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
The analysis is being used to evaluate the accuracy of how the umpire is
making their calls.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
The umpires were loosing their authority since they were being evaluated
without communication, whereas the high level administration within the
MLB gains from knowing the accuracy of the umpires and would be able to cut
costs if they used technology to do the job of umpires.


### Article 2
 -  Article name.
Property tech companies are helping landlords spy on residents, collect their
data, and even evict them. Critics are calling it an invasion of privacy that
could reinforce inequality.

-  Reference or article citation.
https://www.businessinsider.com/map-landlords-spying-on-residents-with-surveillance-technology-2020-9

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
This article is about new "proptech" which is technology created for real
estate, especially for use in the area of renting properties, and the
issues surrounding the use of this technology. Residents are uncomfortable
with the unknown surrounding the usage and sharing of their data after it has
been collected, and how closely proptech is able to track their actions.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
The most concerning element here is the use of facial recognition technology.
If the data set used to train the AI completing the facial recognition is
trained on a biased data set, the AI will discriminate in evaluating the
residents it is being used on. A specific example of this occurring is tech
having to do with buying and selling properties since that historical data
will include how neighborhoods were redlined in the past.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
The data of the residents, including facial recognition data, their movements
and actions when leaning or entering their residence, and their actions
within the neighborhood

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
The analysis is the decision on the part of the landlord to continue renting
property or not to the individuals that are tracked and found to be doing
anything the landlord does not approve of

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
The residents under surveillance are at a higher risk of loosing housing,
wheras the landlords gain more control over their residents.
