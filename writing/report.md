- Briefly describe the article's premise.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
The most concerning element here is the use of facial recognition technology.
If the data set used to train the AI completing the facial recognition is
trained on a biased data set, the AI will discriminate in evaluating the
residents it is being used on. A specific example of this occurring is tech
having to do with buying and selling properties since that historical data
will include how neighborhoods were redlined in the past.

been collected, and how closely proptech is able to track their actions.
